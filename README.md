## Snake and Ladder Game - A Bash Scripting Learning Project
Welcome to the Snake and Ladder Game project! This fun and interactive game have been developed as part
of my journey in learning Bash scripting. The game replicates the classic Snake and Ladder board game, where players
roll dice and move through the board, encountering snakes and ladders that either set them back or propel them forward. 
The entire game logic has been implemented using Bash scripting, making it an exciting and educational project for me.

## Introduction
The Snake and Ladder Game is a text-based implementation of the popular board game. Players take turns rolling dice, 
and their game pieces move accordingly through the board. The objective is to reach the final position (usually 100) before the 
opponents.

## How to Play
1. Clone the repository to your local machine to access the Bash script for the game.

2. Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory.

3. Run the script to start the game:
   - ./snake_and_ladder.sh
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to input the number of players and proceed with the game.

5. Roll the dice when prompted, and watch as your game piece advances through the board.

6. Keep an eye out for snakes and ladders, as they can drastically impact your progress.

7. The game will continue until a player reaches the final position or a specified number of rounds is completed.

## Learning Bash Scripting
This project is a part of my learning journey in Bash scripting. I wanted to challenge myself by creating an interactive 
and engaging game using purely Bash commands. Throughout the development process, I gained valuable insights into Bash scripting
techniques, such as variable handling, loops, conditional statements, and more.

## Disclaimer
Please note that this repository contains the Bash script for the Snake and Ladder Game. The focus of this project is on learning
Bash scripting, and the game's deployment and graphical interface are not provided.
